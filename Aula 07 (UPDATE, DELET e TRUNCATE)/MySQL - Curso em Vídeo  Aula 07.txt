01.
Lines are tuples and columns are fields or attributes.

02.
We can't manipulate several lines at same time, but we can change inside a line in several columns at same time.

03.
To change the name of a column, we update the table, set in some column  and indicate where is the data (where is the primary key). Example: 

	update course set name = 'HTML5' where courseid = '1';

04.
And to change more than one column in one line, we just do a double set with a comma.
Example: 

	update course set name = 'PHP', year = '2015' where courseid = '4';

05.
To avoid the risk of change more than one line if there's no primary key to indicate id,
we use the command LIMIT, that helps to set a new data information according to how much
lines we gonna change. 
Example: 

	update course set name = 'Java', year = '2015' where courseid = '5' limit 1;

06.
To change several lines at same time with similar characteristics, we must follow steps
below:

	- On menu, acesse the button "Edit";
	- Preferences;
	- SQL Editor;
	- Search for the box: "Safe updates";
	- Unmark him;
	- Close the window;
	- Below the menu, have buttons with specific icons.
	So, click on the last button called "Reconnect to DBMS"
	- And now, change lines for example:
	update course set year = '2050' where year = '2018';
	- So every data that contains '2018' on column year
	gonna be set as '2050'.

Safe update it suits to avoid mass delete data in a table.

07.
Beside of update, we use DELETE FROM to drop some lines. Example: 

	delete from course where year = '2050' limit 3;

08.
And then, to delete all lines from a table, we digit the command TRUNCATE TABLE or just TRUNCATE. Example: 

	truncate table course;

09.
The difference between DROP TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE is:

	DROP TABLE = Delete the whole table structure.
	TRUNCATE TABLE = Delete all lines from the table.

And also:

	DT = Data Definition Language (Change table structure)
	TT = Data Manipulation Language (Change the stuff form a table)
