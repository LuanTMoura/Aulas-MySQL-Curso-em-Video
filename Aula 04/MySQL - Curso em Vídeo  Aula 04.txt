MySQL - Curso em VÃ­deo  Aula 04



01. 
To delete some database, you use the command: drop database databasename; or CTRL+ENTER;

02.
There are a parameter called Constraint, that are used to limit the type of data
that can go into a table and digited after create database. 
And the command to set this parameter is: default character set utf8 
(utf8 is always lowercase and used to LATAM characters)

03.
Collations are used to organize characters and set by the command default collate utf8_general_ci;

04.
The constraint NOT NULL are used to force the user set something on a field (like a name)
and you digit after the field type.

05.
Birth can be defined by the type: date.

06. 
When we are using the type >enum<, this mean that the user have only the parameters
defined by the table to choose. Example: sex enum ('M','F').

07.
And now, when we define something with the type >decimal<, we decide a number
that gonna be set before and after comma. 
Example: decimal (5,2) -> Five spaces of digits and two spaces of digitis after comma 
(so, it's possible to digit a nubver like "147,56").

08.
The constraint DEFAULT are used to set optional choose if the user don't have something
to digit. Like: nacionality varchar (20) DEFAULT 'Brasil'.

08.
After creating the fields inside the table, we close the line of command with
DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8;

09.
To differentiate an register, we use an PRIMARY KEY, that create different registers
to smilar fields, like a name. Generally used with int.

10.
There are a constraint to create a rigster after another already created
and is called AUTO_INCREMENT.

11. Using both tips above, we create "id" to differentiate registers, so for example:
"id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT" and at the final of definition em digit "PRIMARY KEY (id)".

12. Constraints are separed by an "_".
